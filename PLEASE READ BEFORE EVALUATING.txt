# ** PLEASE READ BEFORE EVALUATING **

## First off please let me apologies as I was not aware until yesterday that my submission was completely empty. This came to my attention
Sunday April 4th after submitting this weeks challenge. What I discovered was that the entire folder I had for this challenge was gone.

You may be asking why I did not check. Well I had an enormous amount of difficulty with this assignment. Why that was I am not 100 %
clear on as this weeks assignment was a breeze in comparison. I did fall behind in my studies and had some difficulty comprehending what 
was being asked in certain locations which led to much confusion on my part.

The above being said I knew very well from what I had completed that my grade would be dismal at best and was not overly enthusiastic about
confirming it. In fact I don't think I would have gotten above a 50%. Being dissapointed and frustrated with myself I avoided seeing the result.
Why put salt in a wound?

Please note I am aware that not all of my code functions as it should. I have also not made any changes to what I had planned to submit originally.
The only change that has been made is the fact that in the loss of my folder I did lose the entire written section and that did have to be redone.

I am not asking for any special considerations as this is truly on me. I am hoping that this assignment will at least be reviewed and given a grade
based on a math test scenario/late assignment. One may have not gotten the correct answer but showing one's work counts towards something.

I truly appreciate your time and thank you for taking the time to read this.
