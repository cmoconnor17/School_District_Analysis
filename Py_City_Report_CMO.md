# **Py City School Analysis**

## **Overview**

The Purpose of this analysis is to re-run a previous analysis on High School testing and determine the impact of alleged academic dishonesty


### **Analysis/Results:**
	Almost every aspect of this analysis is affected in some way by the omission of the Thompson High grade nine students. Although the impacts may be somewhat insignificant as there were only 461 students there is still an impact.
A list is provided below of the areas impacted:
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* % Overall Passing

The District School Summary is affected as mentioned above in the same areas. As all averages and percentages are affected by a difference in the number of students. However this impact is minimal as there are only 461 out of 36,594 students that have been omitted.

The same can be said for the Individual School Summary. An example of this is if 100 students were added to the roster of Thomas High School the per student budget would decrease. Assuming there is a fixed budget.

In relation to the specific impacts to Thomas High School the above is repeated. All areas would be impacted however without knowing how many specifically were or were not passing in any of the subjects the impact cannot be quantified for those areas or the whole.

### Summary

	The overall impact(s) are quite miminal as the omitted parties represent only ~1% of the total students. In terms of the specific school score(s) as mentioned above this cannot be quantified as we do not know how many grade nine students were or were not 
passing each subject.

What can be said is that ~25% of the total students in the school were affected as 461 of 1635 scores were omitted.

When it comes to the overall ranking as Thomas High School was neither in the top nor the bottom of the rankings there position would only have a slight change be that up or down. 
	
## **Reccomendations:**

During the analysis it could be assumed that there may or may not be dishonesty in other schools. That said the below reccomendations are suggested.
1) Create a standardized test for all/each grade.
2) Administor the test similar to exams, a specific date and time.
3) Have a third party grade or process the tests.
